# ChEER: Chinese Editing Enhancement & Refinement

[[中文](./README-ZH.md) | English]

Inspired by [Yaozhuwa/easy-typing-obsidian](https://github.com/Yaozhuwa/easy-typing-obsidian), **ChEER** is a VSCode extension designed to improve the Chinese editing experience. By offering smart symbol pairing, wrapping, character conversion, and more, it makes your typing more natural and efficient.

## Features

- **Smart Chinese symbol pairing**: Type and delete paired punctuation like `《》`. Save keystrokes and streamline your flow.  
  Example: Type `《` → Get `《》`

- **Chinese symbol wrapping**: Surround selected text with paired Chinese punctuation instead of replacing it.  
  Example: Select text → Type `《` → Result: `《Selected Text》`

- **Continuous input conversion**: Repeatedly typing certain Chinese characters can convert them to corresponding Latin characters.  
  Example: Type `《` again → Get `<`

- **Empty list item deletion**: Delete entire empty list items with a single keystroke.

- **Change Activation Language**: Currently, ChEER is designed primarily for Markdown, plain text, and LaTeX environments. 
 However, you can modify the activation languages to enable ChEER in other environments where Chinese editing is needed.

- **More features coming...**
